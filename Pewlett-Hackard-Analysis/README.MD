## Overview of the Analysis
The first part of the analysis was to determine the amount of employees that were eligible to retire as well as what positions our company would need to replace. The second part of the analysis was to look at employees that were eligible to be mentors for a company-wide mentorship program.

## Results
The first part of the analysis was focused on number of eligible employees for retirement. Based off the first part of the analysis, our company should review the following:

* Engineers and Senior Staff are the two positions that have the most eligible members ready for retirement. Human Resources should be focused on maintaining our top engineering talent and finding ways to recruit new engineers. Additionally, finding ways to help grow our current staff to become senior staff members is paramount for a healthy company moving forward.
* Most of our employees who are eligible for retirment began their careers in the 1980s. Although it is highly improbable we will be able to replace them with individauls with the same amount of experience, we may be able to find younger and more affordable talent.
* Based off the analysis, most of the employees that are eligible to be retired also saw several promotions throughout their time at our company. This gives us a good sense that we are a company where workers can find growth and opportunity.
* Managers were the group that had the least amount of workers eligible for retirement and the only group that was in the single digits. Additional analysis should be done here to see why there is such a low volume of eligible employees.

The second part of the analysis was focused on number of eligible employees eligible to be mentors for our company wide mentorship program.
